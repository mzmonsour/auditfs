# Auditfs

A simple, auditing filesystem.

The goal of this project is not to create a performant, well designed
filesystem. Rather, the main goal is to learn about the Linux kernel ecosystem,
and produce a program that demonstrates a solid understanding of the VFS and
Linux kernel modules.

## Build instructions

Requires: GNU Make, GCC, Linux kernel build files

Simply run `make` or `make all` to build all targets
